' -- Verison 2.0 released on February 2014
'    - imports ODS data from XML files (reported on 2014) to ODS database
'    - imports F-Gases data from XML files (reported on 2014) to FDB database
'    - year 2014 updates (http://taskman.eionet.europa.eu/issues/17951) for FDB import:
'       * amending the import routine (BDR to FDB): entering a ‘company short name’ into FDB in case of a new reporter
'       * amending the import routine for missing gases in 1st Jan stocks: (not yet communicated with Enriko):
'        there are cases, where a company had a 31st December stock in year x-1 but did not select that gas in year x; Example: https://bdr.eionet.europa.eu/fgases/gb/fgas23363/envuuctlg/AutomaticQA_85869_1363192562
'        we DO then have a warning (potential error) in the automatic QC; We NEED an entry to be written into the FDB with transaction_ID 8 (Stocks_held_1 January) for the gas in question: value: (empty); Comment_value_t prefilled with a text “31st Dec stocks were reported in previous year” + Warning flag set ON.
'       * Adding Croatia to the list of eligible countries for moving reports from BDR to the FDB (highest priority)
'           only reports for transactions in 2013 and later are eligible for moving from BDR to the FDB
'       * We slightly changed the structure of gas & blends related tables in the FDB (and add the 2nd Assessment report GWPs as requested by Eva). The import routine (BDR to FDB) in case of new preparations defined by reporting companies might need to be adapted. New FDB schema is attached.
'       * Adapt the import routine so that ID37 would be imported for non-producers as well. Currently the import routine only sets the ID37 flag for Producers by comparing the Calculated Total and the Total amount placed on the Community market.
