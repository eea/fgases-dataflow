# FGases gas list generation script

## Input requirements

1. **$gas-list-ods-uri**: The URI of the new gas list. The new gas list should be the XML content of an ODS document that conforms to the format of the sample _fgases-gas-list-with-composition.ods_.
2. **$old-gas-list-xml-uri**: The URI of the old gas list, in the same XML format used by the webform.

## Considerations

- The new gas list file is expected to be generated by an **inner join** between the _Gases_ and _Components_ tables from the **FDB**. Hence, the file is supposed to contain the component compositions of each FGas, _one component per spreadsheet line_.
- The old gas list is required because the **inner join** performed to produce the new gas list spreadsheet described above will omit any components not included in at least one gas. Thus, these components need to be fetched from the old gas list which contains them all. The validity of this logic is based on the fact that no new standard components are added to the components list (confirmed by the ETC).
