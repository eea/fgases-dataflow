        <intro-h>INTRODUCTION</intro-h>
        <intro-1>The &lt;a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.150.01.0195.01.ENG"&gt;Regulation (EU) No 517/2014&lt;/a&gt;, requires reporting on production, import, export, feedstock use, and destruction of the substances listed in Annexes I or II of the F-Gas regulation. These reporting forms are to be completed by each:</intro-1>
        <li-1>producer, importer and exporter that produced, imported or exported one metric tonne or 100 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent or more of F-gases. The reportable quantity of F-gases imported or exported covers bulk shipments, including F-gases shipped with equipment for the purpose of charging that equipment.</li-1>
        <li-2>company that destroyed 1 metric tonne or 1 000 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent or more of F-gases;</li-2>
        <li-3>company that used 1 000 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent or more of F-gases as feedstock;</li-3>
        <li-5>company that authorised the use of HFC quota to another undertaking.</li-5>
        <li-4>company that placed on the EU market 500 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalent or more of F-gases contained in imported products or equipment;</li-4>
        <intro-2>This electronic reporting tool is based on the format set out in &lt;a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1415192747341&amp;uri=OJ:JOL_2014_318_R_0004"&gt;Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1191/2014&lt;/a&gt;,</intro-2>
        <confidentiality-h>CONFIDENTIALITY</confidentiality-h>
        <confidentiality>All information provided via these reporting forms are treated as strictly confidential. No company-specific information is disclosed to the public; all company data are aggregated into summary reports before publication. The Commission and the EEA have established procedures to ensure that all of the data relating to individual companies remains strictly confidential even if it could plausibly be deduced from aggregate figures. No company-specific information is disclosed to the public; all company data are aggregated into summary reports before publication. These procedures limit the release of aggregate figures that might significantly rely on reports from less than three company groups. To this end, company groups that contribute to less than 5 % of an aggregate figure do not count toward the 'three company rule'. Company groups are defined according to affiliations to other companies as reported by both affiliates in the Company Information tab. Concerns regarding confidentiality can be addressed to the Commission or to the entity designated by the Commission.</confidentiality>
        <instructions-h>INSTRUCTIONS</instructions-h>
        <instructions>After updating and/or confirming your Company Information form (from the tab above), the "Years &amp; Activities" tab will then be visible. Based upon your selections for activities conducted in the previous calendar year, appropriate reporting forms will be automatically available. Activities conducted in any year should be reported and submitted, no later than 31 March of the following year. For your reference, a &lt;a href="http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/f-gas/docs/faq_reporting_en.pdf"&gt;'Frequently Asked Questions' (FAQ) list&lt;/a&gt; is available from the help section of the BDR.</instructions>
        <instructions-2>Please note that for producers and importers the 1st January stocks will be automatically imported into section 4A/B/C based on the 31st December stocks data reported last year in section 4F/G/H. You have the option to manually edit those numbers.</instructions-2>

            There should be no need for reporting authorisations outside the scope of 9A_imp, as authorisations can only be used by the recipient to cover their equipment imports in case the authorisation was duly registered in the HFC registry by 31 December.
            If you are sure that your report should deviate in section 9A from the data as given in 9A_imp, please add a comment to explain why your authorisations were not registered in the HFC registry. You must be able to provide proof during quota compliance checking at a later time.

Please do not repeat in 9A_add authorisations that are covered in the HFC registry and contained in the data of section 9A_imp.

If you are sure that your report should deviate in section 9A from the data as given in 9A_imp, please add a comment to explain why your authorisations were not registered in the HFC registry.
